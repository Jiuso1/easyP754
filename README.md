### What it is

A JavaFX app that shows the IEEE P754 representation of the number entered. All
calculations done are shown. 1000 decimals are used in almost every operation.

If you want to use easyP754, clone this repository and open the folder with IntelliJ.

### Supported precision modes

* Simple precision (32b).
* Double precision (64b).
* Half precision (16b).
* Quadruple precision (128b).
* Octuple precision (256b).

### Input examples

```text
3.1416
```

```text
-3.3254343
```

```text
23E10
```

```text
2^3
```

```text
2^-127
```

```text
+0
```

```text
-inf
```

### Class diagram

The class diagram has helped us a lot to create organized and readable software for humans.
[uml.txt](src/main/resources/uml.txt) has PlantUML code that generates the following class diagram.

![Class diagram](src/main/resources/uml.png)

1. ApplicationView asks the user for a text input.
2. UserInput generates a 100%-OK input for Calculator.
3. Calculator generates a UserOutput for a given UserInput, with all calculation data stored in Calculation.
4. ApplicationView shows UserOutput to the user.

We've applied the **Model View Controller** design pattern, but in the future, we'll add more design patterns!

### To do

1. Improve GUI. The graphical user interface should be easy to use and read.
2. Launch first release.

### Tech used

* [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com)
* IntelliJ IDEA
* Java
* JavaFX

### Project acknowledgments

First I want to
thank [Dr. Manuel Joaquín Redondo González](https://produccioncientifica.uhu.es/investigadores/211190/detalle?lang=en)
for all hours we've been analyzing and improving this app.
I wait for these hours to pay off so that future _Computer Structure_ students will solve the exam problem easily.

I also want to thank **all future students** who will improve this app. Thanks to them easyP754 will keep improving, and
they deserve recognition in the project. I hope it will be a successful open-source project.

Last, I want to dedicate this app to [Borja López Pineda (BorjaLive)](https://github.com/BorjaLive). He had a huge
heart and helped lots of
partners by pure altruism, and he coded lots of similar projects to this one.
His closest friend [Diego Ortiz Más (SoyKhaler)](https://github.com/soykhaler) has given us permission to do so, and I
also thank him for being so
kind.

In summary, I dedicate this application to Borja wherever he is.

### Personal acknowledgments

Thanks to all my friends and family. Without their support, this app couldn't exist.

My brother Héctor García Gutiérrez gave me the idea of supporting the key button to calculate.
He has supported me a lot and he has always liked my application.

Manuel Camacho Campos ([iBManu](https://github.com/iBManu)) and Jesús Bogarín Hernández have always been there. They
always have inspired and motivated me.

[Andriy Yaskiv](https://github.com/Andriyaskiv) has always made me smile and reminded me that soft skills are equal as
important as hard skills.

Ignacio Velázquez Muñoz has helped me to grow my vision and dreams. Long walks that made things clear.

This app is in honor of them and more people who, due to text size problems, do not appear.
